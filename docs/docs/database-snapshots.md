# Database Snapshots

Database snapshots let you quickly start your node without having to download all blocks from the very beginning. Instead, you use a pre-made version of the database that’s already in sync up to a certain block. This saves you a lot of time, especially if the network has many blocks.

## Available Snapshots

Please check our [snapshot download page](http://rpc.pathfinder.swmansion.com/snapshots/latest) for the list of latest snapshots.

There are two main ways to download and use a snapshot with Pathfinder:

* [Using Rclone](#using-rclone-for-snapshots)
* [Using a direct HTTPS link](#downloading-via-https)

## Using Rclone for Snapshots

[**Rclone**](https://rclone.org/) is a command-line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is highly recommended for Pathfinder snapshots due to its reliability and support for resumable downloads.

### Rclone Configuration

1. Follow the [official installation guide](https://rclone.org/install/) for your operating system.
2. Open or create your Rclone configuration file (`$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`) and add:
   ```ini
   [pathfinder-snapshots]
   type = s3
   provider = Cloudflare
   env_auth = false
   access_key_id = 7635ce5752c94f802d97a28186e0c96d
   secret_access_key = 529f8db483aae4df4e2a781b9db0c8a3a7c75c82ff70787ba2620310791c7821
   endpoint = https://cbf011119e7864a873158d83f3304e27.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
   acl = private
   ```
3. Use `rclone ls` to get a list of snapshot files:
   ```bash
   rclone ls pathfinder-snapshots:pathfinder-snapshots/
   ```
3. Choose the appropriate snapshot and then use `rclone` to copy the compressed SQLite file to your local directory:
   ```bash
   rclone copy -P pathfinder-snapshots:pathfinder-snapshots/mainnet_0.18.0_1674344.sqlite.zst .
   ```

:::tip 
Add `-P` to get a progress display that helps you track the download status.

## Downloading via HTTP

The snapshot endpoint currently uses HTTP. Use `--continue` so interrupted downloads can be resumed:

```bash
wget --continue http://rpc.pathfinder.swmansion.com/snapshots/latest/mainnet.sqlite.zst
```

## Extracting Snapshots and Checksums

Snapshots come as zstd-compressed SQLite files. Once the download completes, follow these steps:

1. Compare the file’s checksum against the published value to ensure data integrity:
   ```bash
   sha256sum mainnet.sqlite.zst
   # Compare with the hash listed on the snapshot download page
   ```
2. Use `zstd` (version 1.5 or later) to extract:
   ```bash
   zstd -T0 -d mainnet.sqlite.zst -o mainnet.sqlite
   ```
   This produces an uncompressed file, e.g., `mainnet.sqlite`.

3. If you intend to replace your existing database, **stop** the Pathfinder process, rename or remove your old database, and move the new file into place. For example:
   ```bash
   mv mainnet.sqlite /path/to/your/pathfinder/data/mainnet.sqlite
   ```
   Ensure your file names and paths match the network you’re running.
